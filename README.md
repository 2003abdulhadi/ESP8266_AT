# ESP8266_AT
Driver for ESP8266 using AT commands for STM32 MCU's

# WARNING
This driver is still work in progress. It is not in a fully useable state. Source code may change drastically, use at your own risk.

# Current Goals
1. Implement a way to share the usart definition to the header
2. Complete function declarations
3. Complete function definitions
4. Complete function comments
5. Define and implement Rx

I also want to work on using function macros to reduce the amount of boiler plate (lots of repeated code with HAL_UART_Transmit).
